          Some people leave behind wealth, fame, or power. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam left behind something even greater — inspiration. 
          A scientist, a teacher, a dreamer, and the People’s President, he lived a life of service and simplicity. 
          I admire him not just for what he achieved, but for how he remained grounded through it all.
